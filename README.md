# omega tau Episode Preparation

This repository is used for collaborative editing of omega tau episode scripts, which for the basis for the interviews.

## Who can edit

Everyone can edit. Please make sure you add construstive questions and stay on topic. 

## What to change

Please do not delete other people's questions. You are free to rephrase to make it clearer, but don't just delete things you don't like. For bigger edits that restructure the whole script, please create a branch.

## Are your questions guaranteed to be in the show?

If you add good questions relevant to the topic, it is very likely that they will end up in the show. But there is no guarantee: as editors, @markusvoelter and Nora reserve the freedom to do a final edit of the script before we use it.
