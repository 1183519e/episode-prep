More subtle, yet important questions like:

Engineering/Materials:
* Why is the complexity of fusion a reason for confidence in its future?
* How should we evaluate the outlook for fusion startups compared to governmental projects?
* To what degree does fusion actually solve the fission's radioactive waste and weapons proliferation problems? (as Jason mentioned)
* How does the environmental footprint of a fusion plantsÂ´ part production and construction compare to those of the 
  alternatives mentioned in the book? (The CO2 output of solar cell production is mentioned, that of the materials for 
  fusion (Tungsten etc.) is not)
* How much maintainability can be introduced into fusion plant design? (Making part replacement easier to shorten maintenance downtimes)
* What is a reasonable prognosis for the availability of a future fusion plant? (How much maintenance downtime per productive uptime)

Economics
* What electricity network architecture is necessary for the accommodation of future fusion plants? (See also: North/South 
  connection project in Germany and its difficulties)
* What could be a suitable form of organisation to 
* How likely is it that fusion plants will be operated by current energy enterprises? (Business models: Public-Private Partnerships, 
  could Fusion lead to socialisation of electricity infrastructure?)
* Does the heavy industry need to adapt for the production of fusion plant components? (Are the required materials exotic do they 
  require unusual manufacturing processes?)
*
