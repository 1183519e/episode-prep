Scientist
---------------------------------------------
* The scientific goals of the mission
  - Mercury
  
  . Origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star
  . Mercury as a planet â€” its form, interior, structure, geology, composition and craters
  . Mercury's exosphere, composition and dynamics, including generation and escape
  . Mercury's magnetised envelope (magnetosphere) - structure and dynamics
  . Investigate the origin of Mercury's magnetic field
  . Verify Einstein's theory of general relativity by measuring 
    the parameters gamma and beta of the parameterized post-Newtonian 
    formalism with high accuracy.

  - have we been there before?

  
* Mission Overview 
  - who is participating
  - who contributed what

"Spacecraft engineer"
--------------------------------------
* The spacecraft
  - where does the name come from?
  - size - compared to others?
  - "Sub" space
    . Mercury Transfer Module (MTM) for propulsion, built by ESA
    . Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) built by ESA
    . Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (Mio) built by JAXA
  - bus 
    . propulsion
    . attitude control
    . thermal - probably interesting, since going towards sun
    . comms
  - Sensors to achieve the mission on the various subs
  

Controller
-------------------------------
* The process it has gone through so far on the launch pad

* What ias going on in Kourou today

* Mission Control 
  - which roles are in the control center
  - Workshare Kourou vs. ESOC
  - what is the orbit to get it to Mercury
    how long the cruise?

* The launch
  [Here I would like to record the comms loop or get
   your existing recordings so I can grab some parts
   of them for atmosphere and context]
  - step by step: what happens during the launch
  - where did it launch to - orbit? upper stage?
  - taking over the spacecraft after launch
    . how does the handshake work?
    . self-check?
    . what else happens during that night?
  

SysAdmin in Darmstadt
----------------------------------------
* Communication infrastructure between kourou and darmstadt
* Comm infrastructure to the spacecraft
* mission control center infrastructure
  - redundancy
