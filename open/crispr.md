Basics






* Introduction of Krzysztof
  - why is it us talking about this :-)

* What is CRISPR
  - Abbreviation?
  
  CRISPR, is a family of DNA sequences in bacteria that contains
  snippets of DNA from viruses that have attacked the bacterium

* Big picture.
  What is it?
  What was the breakthrough?
  Why is it important?

* Cas9

* Targeted Genomic Cleavage, double stranded break
  - Homing Device
  - Endonuclease

* What then do you do with the break?

* More precise, targets more genes (up to 20)

* Research tool or what is it (now)?

* SImple: a transfection
  (compared to what earlier?)

* Genome Editing

* How does it work, specifically
  - conceptually
  - mechanically

* How does it relate to earlier approaches?

* Applications

* How was it discovered?

* Ethical issues?

* How do you quality control that the editing went well?
  - how reliable are the editing processes?
  

* homologous repair
  gene knockout
  gene tagging
  site-specific mutogenesis
* non-homologous end-joining repair
  mutations
  deletions insertions
  knockouts
  
* Promotor study, reporter gene  
  
* The prob that many genes are involved in many things is still there.  

from creating monkeys with targeted mutations to preventing HIV infection in human cells. 
hinting at CRISPRâ€™s potential to cure any genetic disease. And yes, it might even lead to designer babies.

CRISPR is actually a naturally-occurring, ancient defense mechanism found in a wide range of bacteria

CRISPR: One DNA sequence would be repeated over and over again, with unique sequences in between the repeats
-> why?

Cas: enzymes called Cas (CRISPR-associated proteins), which can precisely snip DNA and slice the hell out of invading viruses. 

How does the CRISPR/Cas defense mechanism work?

What is special about Cas9.

As this point, you can start connecting the dots: Cas9 is an enzyme that
snips DNA, and CRISPR is a collection of DNA sequences that tells Cas9
exactly where to snip
ll biologists have to do is feed Cas9 the right sequence, called a guide RNA, and boom, you can cut and paste bits of DNA sequence into the genome wherever you want.

 All you have to do is design a target sequence using an online tool and order the guide RNA to match.
 
 Occasionally, though, the enzyme still cuts in the wrong place, which is one of the stumbling blocks for wider use, especially in the clinic.
 
* Gene Editing on Living cells seems to be new? No breeding? 
 
* Cutting DNA alone is not enough, because the cell might repair it randomly. 
  So we have to supply the spare.
  
* Also works in Stem Cells

* Target many genes at once. 
 
* Guide RNA 
 
* At this point a research tool for "mouse editing"?
  - What is a knock-out mouse, how did 
  - How did you create them before,
  - how do you do it with CRISPR?
  
Compare to other approaches
zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)

Why is it that CRISPR can be applied to all organisms, not just the typical model ones?

CRISPR could become a major force in ecology and conservation,
