Dothraki Background
---------------------------------------

* Language Creation: why?
* What is Dothraki
* Can you speak some :-) ?
  - is it in the tradition of a particular family? Roman, Germanic?
* How did you get to develop it?
* Vocabulary. How big.
* Is it somehow special for the time, context (100 words for snow ...)

Ingredients of a Language
-------------------------------------

Illustrate ingredients based on Dothraki, but also maybe in 
comparison to other languages you might know.

* Building Blocks of Linguistics (let's talk about some of those)
  - Phonetics, the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception
  - Phonology, the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning (phonemes)
  - Morphology, the study of morphemes, or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
  - Syntax, the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences
  - Semantics, the study of the meaning of words (lexical semantics) and fixed word combinations (phraseology), and how these combine to form the meanings of sentences
  - Pragmatics, the study of how utterances are used in communicative acts, and the role played by context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
  - Discourse analysis, the analysis of language use in texts (spoken, written, or signed)
  - Stylistics, the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
  - Semiotics, the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communicatio


* Sounds 
* Syllables
* Symbols

* Some differences between languages, examples!
  - Case
  - Tenses
  - Genders
  - Pronouns
  - Articles
  - ...

* Are all languages formally (i.e., through an accepted written grammar) defined?


Developing Dothraki
------------------------------------

* Importance of context for the meaning of a word
* Ambiguities? Language is imprecise. Good or bad? 

Facets
-------------------------------

* Evolution over time.
* Dialects vs. Accents

Wrap up
----------------------------------------
* How can you be sure this language is realistic, practical?
