Dothraki Background
---------------------------------------

* Language Creation: why?
  there are already ca. 3000 languages on the planet
* What is Dothraki
* Why does GoT have this language? Why is is spoken (!) on the show?
* Can you speak some :-) ?
  - is it in the tradition of a particular family? Roman, Germanic?
* How did you get to develop it?
* Vocabulary. How big.
* Is it somehow special for the time, context (100 words for snow ...)

Ingredients of a Language
-------------------------------------

Illustrate ingredients based on Dothraki, but also maybe in 
comparison to other languages you might know, such as English :-)

* Phonetics, the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception
  - how many sounds can we make?
  - tone languages, such as Chinese?

* Phonology, the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning (phonemes) 
  - how many vowels and consonants do languages typically have?
  - where are things stressed?
  - vowel harmony: what is this?

* Morphology, the study of morphemes, or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
  - does this relate to cases, etc?

* Syntax, the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences
  - word positions. I heard in Latin they are arbitrary?
  - Chinese is an uninflected language and conveys meaning through word order, 
    adverbials or shared understanding of the context

* Semantics, the study of the meaning of words (lexical semantics) and
  fixed word combinations (phraseology), and how these combine to form the
  meanings of sentences
 
* Pragmatics, the study of how utterances are used in communicative
  acts, and the role played by context and non-linguistic knowledge in the
  transmission of meaning
  - what are "pragmatic" words?
 
* Discourse analysis, Stylistics, Semiotics (outside the scope here)

* Kinds of alphabets:
  - Western vs. Chinese
  - How big, how many symbols, typically?
  
  

* Sounds 
* Syllables
* Symbols

* Some differences between languages, examples!
  - Case
  - Tenses
    . can languages work without (verb) tense?
    . agglutinative: show tense through additions of suffixes to verbs
  - Genders
  - Pronouns
  - Articles
    . some languages do not have (indefinite) articles.
  - ...

* Are all languages formally (i.e., through an accepted written grammar) defined?

* Is Dothraki part of a particular language family?
  - which families are there?
  - how are they roughly different?

Developing Dothraki
------------------------------------

* Importance of context for the meaning of a word

* Ambiguities? Language is imprecise. Good or bad? 

* Evolution over time. How languages change.
  - Dothraki examples?
  - Why have all this background?
  
* Dialects vs. Accents

Wrap up
----------------------------------------
* How can you be sure this language is realistic, practical?
  It is not really used, is it?
  
* Next Projects. Next Languages.
