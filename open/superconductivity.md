Superconductivity
------------------------------------------------

General one on superconductivity and the “usual” LTS materials NbTi and Nb3Sn:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium-titanium
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium-tin


* What is normal conductivity?
  - zero resistance
  - but still magnetic field ("expelled")
* What is superconductivity physically?
  - quantum mech phenomenon
  - Meissner Effect
* Why only at low temperatures?
* Which materials? 
  - what do they have in common? Alloys?
* Different kinds:
  - reponse to magnetic field (and maximum current density)
  - T-crit
  - theory of operation
  - material
* How do we find out about it?
  - history... first discovery?
  - theoretical models?
  - experiments?
  - serendipidy?
* Resistance is actually zero, not just close to it.
  - drops to zero below T-crit
    - Suddenly? What happens at T-crit? Relation T to limiting magnetic field?
  - Can we get to good enough materials in practice to actually achieve this?
* Ceramic High Temp superconductors
  - YBCO (with some missing oxygen atoms in the lattice!)
    - Oxides are usually insulators at RT, in contrast to the "classical" superconductors?
  - Perovskites are also hot in Photovoltaics. Any connection there?
* Higher Temps are better because cooling becomes easier;
  what are useful "thresholds"?
  - Relevance of Tc > 77 K, price of cooling.
* What is quenching? When/why does it happen?
* Actual speed of the electrons? Speed of the signal? Is it faster than in a normal conductor?

Applications
---------------------------------------------------
For all of the applications: discuss their use in ITER and accelerators.

* Why is superconductors relevant?
  - wouldn't *very low* resistance be good enough?

* Superconducting wires

    http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2012/conf/fermilab-conf-12-571-td.pdf
  - why? thinner, less heat, ultimately better efficiency ratio
  - Challenges?
    . avoid quenching, how?
    . how do you cool it?
    . How much energy/Helium is needed for cooling and does this limit further application?
  - Manufacturing
    . What limits the design of magnets (not the material but shapes etc.)? Physical or manufacturing? 
       - material properties, brittleness
    . How does one make sure to cool everything? Just place some wires into a bath of liquid Helium or sophisticated cooling techniques?
  - use in ITER?
  - How do you to electrically connect superconducting cold parts with normal 
    temperature conductors. This gets specially interesting with superconductors 
    cooled by liquid helium and high currents in Kiloampere range.

* Superconducting Cables:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_cable
    https://www.cryogenicsociety.org/resources/defining_cryogenics/cable-in-conduit_conductors/
  - sounds like "thicker wires". Difference? 
    multiple wires in one bigger cable
  - plus a coolant - how is it integrated?
  - Parameters determining whether a superconducting cable is more economic than suffering the electric losses?
     - AC vs DC?

* Superconducting junctions:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Josephson_junction
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect
   
* SQUIDs:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQUID
    
* Superconducting Magnets:

  - these are "just" wound up wires - what is the challenge?
  - Accurate field strength, homogeneous fields, field gradients (MRI/NMR machines)
  - Goal is to create strong magnetic field. What limits that? Strongest existing magnets are not superconducting.
    - Heat?
    - Liquid cooling vs. mechanical cooling.
    - Effect of the generated magnetic field on the superconductivity
  - Quenching - the "accident" at LHC
  
* Magnetic levitation:
  - Superconductor and a conventional magnet
  
* Superconducting RF cavities:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_radio_frequency
  - what are RF cavities?
  - these are not just wound up wires, how do they work?
 
 * Storing energy in superconducting rings
