Superconductivity
------------------------------------------------

General one on superconductivity and the “usual” LTS materials NbTi and Nb3Sn:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium-titanium
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium-tin


* What is normal conductivity?
  - zero resistance
  - but still magnetic field ("expelled")
* What is superconductivity physically?
  - quantum mech phenomenon
  - Meissner Effect
* Why only at low temperatures?
* Which materials? 
  - what do they have in common? Alloys?
* Different kinds:
  - reponse to mag field
  - T-crit
  - theory of operation
  - material
* How do we find out about it?
  - theretical models?
  - experiments?
  - serendipidy?
* Resistance is actually zero, not just close to it.
  - drops to zero below T-crit
  - Can we get to good enough materials in practice to actually achieve this?
* Ceramic High Temp superconductors
  - YBCO
* Higher Temps are better because cooling becomes easier;
  what are useful "thresholds"?
* What is quenching? When/why does it happen?

Applications
---------------------------------------------------
* Why is superconductors relevant?
  - wouldn't *very low* resistance be good enough?

* Superconducting wires

    http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2012/conf/fermilab-conf-12-571-td.pdf
  - why? thinner, less heat, ultimately better efficiency ratio
  - Challenges?
    . avoid quenching, how?
    . how do you cool it?
    . How much energy/Helium is needed for cooling and does this limit further application?
  - Manufacturing
    . What limits the design of magnets (not the material but shapes etc.)? Physical or manufacturing?
    . How does one make sure to cool everything? Just place some wires into a bath of liquid Helium or sophisticated cooling techniques?
  - use in ITER?

* Superconducting Cables:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_cable
    https://www.cryogenicsociety.org/resources/defining_cryogenics/cable-in-conduit_conductors/
  - sounds like "thicker wires". Difference? 
    multiple wires in one bigger cable
  - plus a coolant - how is it integrated?
